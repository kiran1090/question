Important Notes:

Exception handling to be implemented properly

Field values should be properly validated and provided with proper message.

Age should be calculated based on the Date of Birth and Today’s Date. Best practice for naming the class, variables, functions etc should be strictly followed. [Ref: 10 Programming Best Practices to Name Variables, Methods and Class in Java - Examples (javarevisited.blogspot.com)]

Don’t try to copy and paste the program from referencing sites. Will be evaluating the concept that you understand from the program.
